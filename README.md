# Predicting-Parkinsons-Disease-Severity
This project aims to predict the severity of Parkinson’s disease by estimating clinician-rated motor and total UPDRS scores. These predictions are based on remotely collected voice and demographic features from patients. The approach enables non-invasive, continuous monitoring to support timely clinical decisions and improve patient care outcomes.
